So i want you to assist me in creating a navbar. I will state the points in order so as to help with its structure layout

1. The hamburger icon will stick at the top right of the website,and its background will be white. The background will be shaped like the bottom left part of a circle divided in 4(assume the circle is divided into 4 equal parts. i want the shape to be that of the bottom left of that circle. My intention is that it fits perfectly on the top right part of the screen). The hamburger icon looks like three short horizontal sticks, and when clicked to display the navbar, the hamburger will transition to an x. (The top and bottom stick will rotate together to form the x, and the middle one will dissapear). When clicked one more time to close the navbar, the reverse of what i just said will happen so as to restore the hamburger icon to its previous 3 horizontal stick look

2. When the hamburger icon is pressed, its background color will expand to fill the whole page in a transition-like motion (so transition will move from the top right as it moves towards the bottom left filling the whole screen. The navbar menu items are four of them. (Home, Events, Who We Are, and Get In Touch) .They will pop up like they are being drawn upwards from an invisible envelope, from the first nav item to the last(in their listed order). 

3. The navbar items will position themselves in the left side. An image section will be positioned on the right. When the Nav item is hovered on, an image will appear on the image section. Different images will appear based on what nav link is pointed. 

4. Social media links will be available at the center of the below section of the navbar window(think of it as the navbar footer).

5. Every item i have mentioned that will appear in the navigation window will have the same transition effect when the user sees them,where they will pop up like they are being drawn upwards from an invisible envelope.

I want you to help me actualize this in my next.js project. In case the solution requires targeting DOM elements, use useRef. For any css, use css modules.
